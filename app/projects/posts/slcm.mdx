## What is it?

- A simple python bot that sends you an email every time a new document is uploaded on SLcM.
- Sends you 3 most recent pdf docs from the SLcM 'Notifications Tab'.
- Doesn't need your login details. Keep your grades private.
- Took 12+ hours over 3 days to complete. Turns out avoiding logging onto SLcM is the biggest motivator.
- No more 'is this official?', 'wait for confirmation from SC', or any other human delay in communication process.
- Bypasses captcha using Tesseract OCR
- Checks the 3 most recent notification titles, if any changes are detected, downloads said pdfs and sends it as an email to receiver list.  
- Project discontinued, had 500+ users at its peak across university.
